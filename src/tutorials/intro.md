# Basics

This is an introduction. Please read this before other tutorials in order to familiarize yourself with the notations used.

## Sets

We use $\mathbb{N}$ to denote the set of all natural numbers.
Our convention is that natural numbers start with $1$.

Other notations include:

| Notation | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- |
| $\mathbb{Z}$ | The set of all integers |
| $\mathbb{Q}$ | The set of all rational numbers |
| $\mathbb{R}$ | The set of all real numbers |
| $\mathbb{C}$ | The set of all complex numbers |

## Conventions

We usually list every step in detail
Therefore, we assume that you won't encounter any ambiguity and obscurity in our statements and proofs.
However, we still expect common sense
So we point out that $\frac{1}{3}$ is a rational number, but will not say that

Since $1 \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $3 \in \mathbb{N}$, $\frac{1}{3} \in \mathbb{Q}$

It certain makes the statement too verbose and fails to highlight the point(s) that should be emphasized.

## Terminologies

We use the word *trivial* to describe something very simple and straightforward
Please note that this word is widely *misused*, since a lot of *trivial* statements on the Internet are difficult
We will not say something being *trivial* unless it really is.

**Example**

Show by Mathematical Induction that $1+2+...+n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.

**Proof**

The case $n=1$ is trivial. ...

As usual, the word can also describe the simplest example.
For example, $({0}, +)$ is the trivial group.

We use the word *routine* to describe something whose calculation is lengthy, but should not be difficult.

**Example**

Routine calculation shows that $(x+1)(2x+3)(3x+5)(5x+7)=30x^4+167x^3+345x^2+313x+105$.
